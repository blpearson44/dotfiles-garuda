# dotfiles-garuda
These are the files located in my $HOME directory that I use to customize my Linux environment. This is using the method outlined in [BitBucket's tutorial here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). Other files that would otherwise normally be a part of this have not been added as they have not been customized from their default configs. I will try to keep this repo filled mostly with things that I have directly edited myself. Keep in mind that this only includes files that I have personally edited and so may not include all dependencies.
